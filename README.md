Ubuntu Server GUI
=================

GUI client app designed to work with the [Ubuntu Server API](https://github.com/rawberg/ubuntu-server-api).

### Status - Developer Preview
This is a very early version of the app I'm releasing to get developer feedback.

### Install For Developers
    git clone git@github.com:rawberg/ubuntu-server-gui.git ubuntu-server-gui
    cd ubuntu-server-gui
    npm install
    setup a local web server to point to public/index.html (getting started will be easier soon, I promise)

### Tests
- written with [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/)
- open public/test/TestRunner.html in a browser to run them

### Documentation
- for now the tests and source code are the best documentation
- all test cases have been carefully worded to explain what each unit is responsible for
- pretty documentation is coming soon
